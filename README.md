# Trading Strategy Optimization Using LSTM and Dynamic Programming

## Project Overview
This project was submitted to the 2022 Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM) with Control Number 2222562. The goal was to develop an optimal trading system for Bitcoin and Gold assets using advanced machine learning and optimization techniques.

## Key Features
- Price prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ARIMA models
- Portfolio optimization using Monte Carlo simulation and Markowitz model  
- Dynamic Programming for optimal trading timing
- Sensitivity analysis for transaction costs
- Complete trading strategy implementation

## Results
- Successfully transformed $1,000 initial investment into $14,140,234.70
- Determined optimal portfolio weights: 18.8% Gold, 81.2% Bitcoin
- Demonstrated model sensitivity to transaction costs (54% change in Bitcoin returns, 21% in Gold)

## Technical Implementation
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- LSTM model with hyperparameter tuning
- Dynamic Programming for trade timing optimization
- Portfolio weight optimization using Sharpe Ratio
- Extensive visualization and analysis tools
